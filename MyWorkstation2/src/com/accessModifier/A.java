package com.accessModifier;

public class A {
	
	private int data = 40;
	private void msg() {
		// this int and void method couldnt be accessed from anywhere  cuzthey are private..
	}

}



// anything we put private in our class.. it only available in this class.. its not workkng in another clas even tho its in the same package
// if we dont use any access modifier we callthat  default modifier.. by default it have it's own property to apply
